## TODOs
- [x] Release SynthGlyph10K and Better_Background
- [ ] Release inference code and checkpoints
- [ ] Release training code
- [x] Release training dataset and test dataset
- [ ] I will open-source it as soon as possible. If you need anything, feel free to contact me at lizhenhang0506@gmail.com. I will provide the unorganized code and datasets.

## Datasets
